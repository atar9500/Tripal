# Tripal



### The Concept

Tripal is an Android social media app that is dedicated to travellers abroad who seek to meet and hangout with another travellers and locals.

With Tripal, you can see the hangouts around you at the range of 10km, sending requests to hosts to join their hangouts, participate in a chat with all the hangout participants and leave the hangout if they are not interested.
Or, you can host a hangout by yourself, choose from a variety of choises from the map, a place to meet up in range of 10km from you.

After an amount of time (Right now it's 8 hours, but in the future it'll be the user's choice) the hangout you participate in will be ended, it means participants will not have the option to send messages withing the hangout anymore, but the hangout will appear on their list of hangouts they took part in.

Aside from that, users have the option to set a profile image, tell something about themselves so other users can get some details about them before choosing to hangout with them.

Currently users have option to register and log in using email or Google account (in the near future, Facebook as well).
